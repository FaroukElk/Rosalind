Problem involves analyzing a collection of DNA sequences for the most common nucleotide present at each of the sequence's position. We can then use the common nucleotide information to infer a possible ancestor sequence among the collection. 

Input file is a collection of DNA sequences in FASTA format
Output file is a possible common ancestor sequence followed by a matrix for the number of times each nucleotide appears among the collection of sequences.
